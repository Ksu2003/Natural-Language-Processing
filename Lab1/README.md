**Description**: This project aims to create frequency dictionaries for three languages: Russian, English, and one additional language of your choice. The dictionaries are based on text corpora with a minimum of 1 million word usages for each language.

## Features
**Data Collection**: Gather text corpora with at least 1 million word usages for Russian, English, and an additional language.

**Frequency Dictionaries**: Create frequency dictionaries (word + absolute frequency of occurrence) for each language based on the collected texts.

**Console Application**: Demonstrate the dictionaries in a console application.

## Requirements

**Word-Only Entries**: Dictionaries should contain only words, excluding numbers and auxiliary symbols, except for hyphens, apostrophes, etc., that are part of words depending on the language.

## Application Interface
**Language Selection**: A menu to select the language.

**Dictionary Display**: Display the frequency dictionary sorted alphabetically or by frequency (both ascending and descending).

**Word Search**: Search and display words based on a given template from the beginning of the word.

**Word Correction**: Correct words with the ability to update them in texts and sum frequencies if there is a correct spelling.

**Word Deletion**: Delete words from the dictionary with a confirmation prompt (to prevent accidental deletions).

**Manual Addition**: Add new words manually (with zero frequency if they were not in the text).

**Dictionary Update**: Update the frequency dictionary with new texts and recalculate frequencies.
